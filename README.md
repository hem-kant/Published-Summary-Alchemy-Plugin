# Published-Summary-Alchemy-Plugin
SDL Hackathon 2018 - Published Summary Alchemy Plugin
This plugin is intended to do the following:

Get all items within a publication, folder or structure group published to one or more Publishing Target Types.
Let's say if we select Publication then the response will be all Published  Pages, Components, and Categories in that publication.
If we select this plugin from Structure group, then we will have all the published pages in the structure group and same goes for Folder selection all Published ComponentTemplates and Components.
Republish, Unpublish and open a specific item.
Republish or Unpublish multiple items on their respective Publishing Target Types.
Export in CSV.
Filter based on Publishing Target Types, Item Type (Component, Pages etc.), and Published Date Range.
Sorting based on Title, Published Date, Published By, Targets, and TCM URIs.
Searching.
Summary of published building blocks across all publishing target types.


The Published Summary Alchemy Plug-in can help in following scenarios:

You want to export a list of all published items from Tridion for a specific website (or for a specific structure group/folder within a website) in CSV format.
You want to see/export all published items from Tridion for a specific Publishing Target Type and compare among all publishing target types for a specific CMS instance.
You need to know, what all need to be published from Tridion in order to make a specific website up and running similar to an existing website.
You need to know a summary of "how many" specific items are published from Tridion to individual publishing target types.
You need to know about "delta" of published items across publishing target types of a CMS instance.
You need to sync your non-live websites with the live websites in terms of content managed from Tridion.
